## But how do I play the levels?!
- Extract the .mmlv.gz level file
- Place the extracted .mmlv file in your ```AppData\Local\MegaMaker\Levels``` folder
- Open Mega Man Maker
- Go to your downloaded levels to see the level in-game! (It will show up as the actual name of the level in-game as in the level file data, not the level ID)
