# Mega Man Maker batch level downloader
A tool to download multiple Mega Man Maker level times at once!

## How to run
1. Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/midmag/mmm-level-batch-downloader.git
```

2. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script
```
python batchDownloader.py
```

## But how do I play the levels?!
- Extract the .mmlv.gz level file
- Place the extracted .mmlv file in your ```AppData\Local\MegaMaker\Levels``` folder
- Open Mega Man Maker
- Go to your downloaded levels to see the level in-game!
(The level will show up as its actual name in-game as in the level file data, not the level ID)

It is something I created on my own just cause it seemed like a fun challenge :)

I am open to suggestions and features (I have many already planned!) though I apologize if this repository is not updated in a while as I am often busy with other projects.
